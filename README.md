# My Personal Project

For this project, I am making a simulation of a 
crypto exchange, where users can buy and sell various
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. For this 
phase of the project, I am going to start off by making
the basic functionality of the exchange, such as being able
to deposit USD to trade, buying and selling features as well
as giving users the option to withdraw their coins. 

This idea of the project is of particular interest to me 
because I myself am a crypto investor and I thought it would
be very cool to make a crypto related project. 

In future phases of the project, I am planning to add more functionality
to the program such as support for more coins as well as
features like staking, candlestick charts as well as customizable
trading indicators such as moving-averages.

##User stories for phase 1:
- As a user, I want to be able to deposit USD into the exchange to trade
- As a user, I want to be able to buy different coins, which are then added to my portfolio
- As a user, I want to be able to sell my coins back onto the market
- As a user, I want to be able to withdraw my coins to an external wallet (after withdrawing, the coins will no longer
have anything to do with this program and the amount will be subtracted from the user's portfolio)
- As a user, I want to be able to check the balance of my portfolio (how many of each coin I have)
